# Claude Code Academic Project System Overview

## System Architecture

The Claude Code academic project management system provides a streamlined 3-command interface designed specifically for university professors and researchers. The system combines intelligent project scaffolding with comprehensive workflow support for research, teaching, grant, and service projects.

## Core Commands

### Command Structure Design

The system consolidates academic project management into three logical command groups:

1. **`/project-setup [type] [name]`** - Intelligent project initialization
2. **`/project-status`** - Comprehensive project analysis
3. **`/project [subcommand]`** - Unified project management

This design eliminates redundancy while maintaining full functionality, reducing cognitive load and improving workflow efficiency.

### Enhanced Scaffolding Architecture

#### Context-Aware Template System

The system requires project description documents (README.md, PROJECT.md, CONCEPT.md, or PROPOSAL.md) before setup, enabling:

- **Intelligent Content Population:** Templates populated with actual project context rather than generic placeholders
- **Academic Rigor:** Enforced thoughtful project conception before technical setup
- **Context Extraction:** Research questions, methodologies, and timelines derived from descriptions
- **Quality Validation:** Minimum content requirements ensure meaningful scaffolding

#### Project Type Specialization

Each project type receives discipline-specific treatment:

**Research Projects:**
- Research question extraction and methodology identification
- Data management and analysis workflow setup
- Publication timeline and milestone tracking
- Ethical consideration and IRB status integration

**Teaching Projects:**
- Learning objective and pedagogical approach extraction
- Assessment strategy and technology integration planning
- Student engagement method identification
- Course progression and evaluation framework

**Grant Projects:**
- Funding timeline and submission deadline tracking
- Collaboration management and PI coordination
- Budget planning and compliance requirement integration
- Proposal development and review process support

**Service Projects:**
- Committee governance and operational framework
- Meeting management and stakeholder engagement
- Deliverable tracking and progress documentation
- Professional development and network building

## Template Architecture

### Comprehensive Template Matrix

The system provides complete coverage across all project types:

```

- **Timeline Intelligence:** Realistic milestone setting based on project scope
- **Collaboration Framework:** Team coordination and stakeholder management
- **Quality Assurance:** Built-in checkpoints and validation criteria

## Workflow Integration

### Academic Lifecycle Support

The system supports complete academic project lifecycles:

1. **Conception Phase:** Project description creation and validation
2. **Setup Phase:** Intelligent scaffolding with context-aware templates
3. **Development Phase:** Progress tracking and milestone management
4. **Maintenance Phase:** Documentation updates and workflow optimization
5. **Completion Phase:** Knowledge transfer and archival preparation

### Development Environment Integration

#### Nix Flake Configuration

Reproducible development environments with academic tool integration:
- Pandoc for document conversion and academic writing
- Quarto for computational notebooks and reporting
- R and Python for statistical analysis and data science
- Language-specific packages for linguistics research

#### Git Workflow Integration

Academic-appropriate version control patterns:
- Conventional commit standards for research reproducibility
- Branch strategies for collaborative academic work
- Sensitive data protection with project-specific .gitignore patterns
- Long-term preservation and citation requirements

### Hook System Compatibility

Seamless integration with automated workflow systems:
- Session logging for project tracking
- Automated updates and synchronization
- Academic milestone detection and notification
- Progress reporting and accountability measures

## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites Validation System

```bash
# Multi-file detection with fallback hierarchy
PROJECT_DOC=""
if [ -f "README.md" ]; then
    PROJECT_DOC="README.md"
elif [ -f "PROJECT.md" ]; then
    PROJECT_DOC="PROJECT.md"
elif [ -f "CONCEPT.md" ]; then
    PROJECT_DOC="CONCEPT.md"
elif [ -f "PROPOSAL.md" ]; then
    PROJECT_DOC="PROPOSAL.md"
else
    # Comprehensive error guidance with examples
    exit 1
fi

# Content validation for meaningful scaffolding
if [ $(wc -l < "$PROJECT_DOC") -lt 5 ]; then
    # Quality enforcement messaging
    exit 1
fi
```

### Context Extraction Framework

The system reads project descriptions to intelligently populate templates with:
- **Research Questions:** Extracted from description headers and content
- **Methodological Approaches:** Identified from methodology sections
- **Timeline Information:** Derived from scope and complexity indicators
- **Collaboration Details:** Extracted from team and partnership descriptions

### Sub-Command Architecture

Modular design with consistent interface patterns:

```bash
/project [subcommand] [arguments]
├── update    # Documentation synchronization
├── track     # Progress and milestone management
├── fix       # GitHub issue resolution
└── create    # Documentation generation
```

Each sub-command maintains:
- Consistent argument patterns
- Unified error handling
- Comprehensive help systems
- Academic workflow integration
