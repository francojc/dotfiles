# Claude Code Command Guide

## Overview

Claude Code provides 3 streamlined slash commands for complete academic project management, from initial setup through ongoing maintenance and analysis.

## Command Structure

### 1. Project Setup: `/project-setup [type] [name]`

**Purpose:** Initialize new academic projects with intelligent scaffolding

**Prerequisites:** Project description file (README.md, PROJECT.md, CONCEPT.md, or PROPOSAL.md) with meaningful project details

**Project Types:**
- `research` - Research projects with data collection, analysis, and publication workflows
- `teaching` - Course development, pedagogical design, and educational materials  
- `grant` - Proposal development, funding applications, and compliance tracking
- `service` - Committee work, governance, and institutional service

**Enhanced Workflow:**

```bash
# Step 1: Create meaningful project description
cat > README.md << 'EOF'
# Spanish Dialect Corpus Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes phonetic variation in Andalusian Spanish through 
corpus-based sociolinguistic analysis, focusing on vowel reduction patterns.

## Research Questions
- How does social class affect vowel reduction in unstressed syllables?
- What are the geographic distribution patterns across Andalusian provinces?

## Methodology  
Mixed-methods approach combining sociolinguistic interviews and acoustic analysis.
EOF

# Step 2: Run intelligent setup with context-aware templates
/project-setup research "Spanish Dialect Corpus"
```

**What It Creates:**

- CLAUDE.md with project-specific guidance derived from description
- specs/ directory with contextual planning, progress, and implementation templates
- Development environment (flake.nix)
- Project-appropriate .gitignore patterns

### 2. Project Status: `/project-status`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive project analysis and reporting

**Features:**

- Current progress assessment
- File structure analysis
- Git status and recent activity
- Documentation quality evaluation
- Next steps recommendations

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run from any project directory
/project-status
```

### 3. Project Management: `/project [subcommand]`

**Purpose:** Unified project management with specialized sub-commands

**Available Sub-Commands:**

#### `/project update`
- Documentation synchronization
- AI-powered project recommendations
- File organization analysis
- Progress tracking updates

#### `/project track`
- Progress tracking and milestone management
- Task completion monitoring
- Timeline analysis
- Goal achievement assessment

#### `/project fix [issue-number]`
- GitHub issue analysis and resolution
- Code debugging assistance
- Problem identification and solutions
- Integration with repository workflow

#### `/project create [type]`
- Documentation and specs creation
- Template generation for specific needs
- Academic writing assistance
- Project artifact development

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Update project documentation and get recommendations
/project update

# Track progress and milestones
/project track

# Fix specific GitHub issue
/project fix 42

# Create additional documentation
/project create specs
```

**CLAUDE.md Includes:**
- Grant opportunity and funder information
- Proposal concept and collaborators
- Budget and compliance requirements
- Submission strategy

### Service Projects

**Focus:** Committee work, governance, institutional service

**Templates Generated:**
- specs/planning.md - Committee overview and responsibilities
- specs/progress.md - Meeting logs and deliverable tracking

## Help and Discovery

### Command Help
```bash
# General help for all commands
/help

# Project command help and sub-commands
/project help

# Specific sub-command help
/project help update
/project help track
/project help fix
/project help create

# Project setup help and types
/project-setup help
```

### Tab Completion
- `/project` + TAB → shows available sub-commands
- `/project-setup` + TAB → shows project types (research, teaching, grant, service)
- `/project create` + TAB → shows documentation types

## Benefits and Features

### Intelligent Scaffolding
- Templates populated with actual project context from descriptions
- Research questions and methodologies automatically extracted
- Realistic timelines based on project scope
- Academic discipline-specific workflows

### Academic Rigor
- Enforces thoughtful project conception before setup
- Ensures meaningful documentation from project start
- Promotes proper academic planning sequence
- Context validation prevents generic scaffolding

### Workflow Integration
- Seamless integration with git workflows
- Compatible with existing hook system
- Natural command progression through project lifecycle
- Extensible foundation for automation

### Professional Organization
- Centralized specs/ directory for all project documentation
- Consistent structure across project types
- Version control friendly organization
- Academic best practices embedded

## Success Criteria

After successful project setup:
- [ ] Project description validated for sufficient detail
- [ ] CLAUDE.md generated with project-specific content
- [ ] specs/ directory created with contextual templates
- [ ] Development environment configured (flake.nix)
- [ ] Project-appropriate .gitignore patterns applied
- [ ] Templates populated with intelligent content
- [ ] Academic workflow foundation established

## Advanced Usage

### Command Aliases
Create shortcuts for frequent commands:
```bash
alias ps='/project-status'
alias pu='/project update'
alias pt='/project track'
alias pf='/project fix'
alias pc='/project create'
```

### Workflow Integration
Natural progression through project phases:
```bash
# Complete project lifecycle
/project-setup research "New Study"
/project-status
/project create additional-specs
/project track
git add -A && git commit -m "Initial project setup"
/project update
```

### Hook System Compatibility
Commands work seamlessly with automated project update hooks for enhanced workflow automation and session logging.

This streamlined command structure provides comprehensive academic project management with intelligent scaffolding, ensuring meaningful project documentation and efficient workflow integration.
