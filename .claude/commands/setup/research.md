---

Please create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of this research repository. This document should provide a comprehensive research-focused summary of the project to guide further contributions and AI assistance.

### Include the following sections:

Working title (optional): $ARGUMENTS

1. **Research Overview**
   - Clearly state the central research question or hypothesis.
   - Describe the significance and motivation behind the research.
   - Summarize expected outcomes or theoretical contributions.

2. **Research Objectives**
   - List the specific goals of the study.
   - Include hypotheses to be tested or sub-questions to explore.

3. **Methodology**
   - Outline the research design and data collection methods.
   - Specify tools, frameworks, or statistical techniques to be used.
   - Mention any coding, modeling, or simulation tasks.

4. **Literature Review**
   - Summarize key theories or prior research influencing this project.
   - Highlight any gaps this study seeks to address.
   - Optionally, cite key references using appropriate academic formatting.

5. **Target Audience**
   - Identify who will benefit from this research (e.g., scholars, educators, policy-makers, or industry professionals).

6. **Expected Contribution**
   - Clarify how the study contributes to knowledge, theory, practice, or methodological innovation.

### Repository Context

- Inspect the repository for existing documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `research_notes/`, `notebooks/`, `data/`, `papers/`).
- Use available content to enrich the CLAUDE.md with accurate project-specific information.
- Consider file structure, code comments, and dependency declarations when inferring methodology or tools used.

### Usage Guidance for Claude:

When assisting with this repository, prioritize the following:

- Maintain research rigor and academic integrity.
- Provide assistance in literature synthesis and framing research arguments.
- Support in quantitative/qualitative data analysis and interpretation.
- Recommend methodological refinements.
- Aid in academic writing, editing, and citation formatting (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).

The resulting `CLAUDE.md` should be well-structured using clear headings and bullet points where appropriate.
