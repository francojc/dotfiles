   - Name of the committee, subcommittee, or task force.
   - Scope or charge of the group (e.g., curriculum review, hiring, assessment, DEI, IT policy).

2. **Purpose & Goals**
   - Summarize the current goals or agenda items for the academic year or term.
   - Identify specific deliverables (e.g., annual report, proposal, recommendation memo, event planning).
   - Note relevant policies, procedures, or institutional priorities guiding the work.

3. **Membership & Roles**
   - List members, roles (chair, secretary, liaison), and term dates (if appropriate).
   - Include any campus units or stakeholders represented.
   - Specify protocols for rotating membership, quorum, or consensus-building.

4. **Meeting Structure & Documentation**

   - Describe conventions for agenda setting, minute-taking, and archiving.
   - Reference folders or files for agendas, minutes, or vote records.

   - Note any expectations for asynchronous work, deadlines, or use of collaborative tools.
   - Provide links or references to related committees, working groups, or past reports.

6. **Repository Structure**
   - Explain how the repo is organized (e.g., `minutes/`, `reports/`, `archive/`, `templates/`).
   - Point out any naming conventions or file format preferences (e.g., Quarto, Markdown, PDF).
   - Include guidelines for maintaining document version history and change tracking.
