    Create a CLAUDE.md file summarizing the course, including context, goals, design, materials, assessment, and guidance for contributors.
---

Please create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of this **teaching-related** or **course-based** repository. This document should guide contributions, instructional alignment, and AI assistance within an educational context.

### Include the following sections:

1. **Course Context**
   - Course title, level (e.g., undergraduate, graduate), and discipline.
   - Target learners (e.g., majors, general education, language learners).
   - Term/frequency of offering and institutional setting, if applicable.

2. **Instructional Goals**
   - State the overarching learning goals for the course or module.
   - Highlight key competencies students are expected to develop (e.g., critical thinking, academic writing, L2 fluency, data literacy).

3. **Pedagogical Design**
   - Outline the instructional design approach (e.g., task-based, backward design, inquiry-based, flipped learning).
   - Describe how lessons, activities, or assignments are structured.
   - Note any alignment with frameworks (e.g., ACTFL Can-Do Statements, Bloom's Taxonomy, CEFR levels, ACRL Framework).

4. **Materials & Resources**
   - Summarize the kinds of materials included in the repository: slides, readings, exercises, assessments, media, source texts, etc.
   - Describe any tech dependencies or platforms (e.g., Jupyter, Quarto, swirl, LMS integrations).

5. **Assessment & Feedback**
   - Describe how student learning is assessed (e.g., rubrics, portfolios, quizzes, peer review).
   - Indicate if automated feedback or scaffolding tools are provided (e.g., grammar checkers, AI tutoring, guided reflections).

6. **Accessibility & Inclusion**
   - Describe any efforts made to ensure accessibility (e.g., alt text, screen reader compatibility, linguistic accessibility).
   - Note strategies for inclusive pedagogy (e.g., culturally responsive content, multimodal materials).

7. **Instructor & Contributor Guidance**
   - Provide expectations for future collaborators (e.g., TAs, co-instructors, instructional designers).
   - List conventions for naming, file organization, lesson templates, etc.

### Repository Context

When generating this document:

- Review course syllabi, `README.md`, `modules/`, `assignments/`, `rubrics/`, or `resources/` folders for relevant content.
- Infer pedagogical approaches from code comments, metadata, or documentation.
- Annotate technologies or workflows relevant for instructional use.

### Usage Guidance for Claude:

When assisting with this repository, prioritize:

- Enhancing pedagogical coherence and scaffolding.
- Drafting or refining lesson plans, activities, and formative assessments.
- Ensuring accessibility and inclusiveness.
- Aligning content with instructional goals and educational standards.
- Helping with rubric creation, syllabus language, and student-facing clarity.
- Assisting in the localization, translation, or adaptation of materials for diverse learners.

Use structured formatting, bullet points, and clearly labeled sections to maximize readability and instructional usability.
