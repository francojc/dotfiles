- **`fix [issue-number]`** - Analyze and fix GitHub issues with automated workflow
- **`create [type]`** - Create project documentation (specs, planning docs, etc.)

### Sub-Command Dispatcher

Parse the first argument to determine which sub-command to execute:

```bash
SUBCOMMAND="$1"
shift  # Remove subcommand from arguments
REMAINING_ARGS="$*"

case "$SUBCOMMAND" in
    update|sync)
        # Execute project-update functionality
        ;;
    track|progress)
        # Execute tracking functionality  
        ;;
    fix|issue)
        # Execute GitHub issue fixing
        ;;
    create|new|spec|specs)
        # Execute documentation creation
        ;;
    help|--help|-h)
        # Show help information
        ;;
    *)
        # Default to update if no subcommand specified
        ;;
esac
```

## Sub-Command Implementations

### 1. Update Sub-Command (`/project update`)

   - Follow project coding standards and conventions
   - Add or update tests to verify the fix
   - Update documentation if needed

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
   - Perform linting and type checking
   - Test the specific fix against issue reproduction steps
   - Verify edge cases and error handling

5. **Submission Workflow**
   - Create descriptive commit message linking to issue
   - Push changes to feature branch
   - Create pull request with detailed description
   - Link PR to original issue for automatic closure

#### Usage Examples

```bash
/project fix 123           # Fix GitHub issue #123
/project fix bug-login     # Fix issue by title search
/project issue 456         # Alternative syntax
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid Sub-Commands

```bash
if [ "$SUBCOMMAND" != "update" ] && [ "$SUBCOMMAND" != "track" ] && 
   [ "$SUBCOMMAND" != "fix" ] && [ "$SUBCOMMAND" != "create" ] &&
   [ "$SUBCOMMAND" != "help" ]; then
    echo "Error: Unknown sub-command '$SUBCOMMAND'"
    echo "Run '/project help' for available sub-commands"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Missing Arguments

```bash
if [ "$SUBCOMMAND" = "fix" ] && [ -z "$REMAINING_ARGS" ]; then
    echo "Error: 'fix' sub-command requires an issue number or identifier"
    echo "Usage: /project fix <issue-number>"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Project Context Validation

```bash
# Check if we're in a project directory
if [ ! -f "CLAUDE.md" ] && [ ! -d "specs" ] && [ ! -d ".git" ]; then
    echo "Warning: This doesn't appear to be a project directory"
    echo "Consider running '/project-setup [type]' first"
fi
```

## Integration Benefits

This unified command structure provides:

1. **Simplified Interface** - Single entry point for all project management tasks
2. **Consistent Workflows** - Common patterns across all sub-commands
3. **Better Discoverability** - Help system guides users to appropriate functionality
4. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new sub-commands without polluting command namespace
5. **Hook Integration** - Works seamlessly with the project update hook system
6. **Academic Focus** - Maintains discipline-specific workflows and best practices

The `/project` command replaces the need for separate project-update.md, tracking.md, fix-gh-issue.md, and create-specs.md commands while preserving all their functionality in a more organized, discoverable format.
